# Retail_Data_Mining

This repository contains code from a Data Mining course group project. ["Data_Mining_Project_Report_Spring24.pdf"](https://github.com/gtwallon/Retail-Data-Mining/blob/main/Data_Mining_Project_Report_Spring24.pdf) is the final report we completed, summarizing our work, and our [project website](https://gabew17.wixsite.com/dmproject) provides a similar summary and other supporting details. All of the code I authored is in the ["hypothesis_test_order_consolidated_modeling.ipynb"](https://github.com/gtwallon/Retail-Data-Mining/blob/main/hypothesis_test_order_consolidated_modeling.ipynb) notebook.
